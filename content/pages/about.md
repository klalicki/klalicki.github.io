# About{.page-title}

Hi! I'm a designer & developer based out of Kingston, New York. I grew up just across the river in Red Hook, NY (the Dutchess County town, not the Brooklyn neighborhood), and I have a BFA in Graphic Design from SUNY New Paltz. If I'm not making things, I'm probably outside, hiking, roller skating or riding my bike.

# Contact {.page-title}

Interested in working with me?

Just wanna say hi?

Feel free to drop me a line at

This site is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator that runs in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). This site was originally created during a workshop I organized at SUNY New Paltz's 2023 Design Week, where I introduced students to the power and flexibility of static-site generators.

## tools & libraries
